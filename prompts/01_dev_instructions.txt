As an expert senior software developer, your task is to implement a MCP (Model Context Protocol) in Python.
The server must use the low-level mcp.server.Server with the stdio transport

The server exposes a tool called start_oblique_thinking
the tool has no arguments
It simply return this result text:
"""Now {thinking_text}
<thinking>
{card}"""

with thinking_text and card being randomly picked from the lists below.

Depending on the command line argument server.py is called with:
- no argument: result as above    
- argument = "1": omit {thinking_text}
- argument = "2": omit {card}

Tool description:

"""
These thinking strategies evolved from our separate observations on the principles underlying what we were doing. Sometimes they were recognized in retrospect (intellect catching up with intuition), sometimes they were identified as they were happening, sometimes they were formulated.

Use this tool when a dilemma occurs in a working situation. The function is trusted even if its appropriateness is quite unclear. Results are not final, as new ideas will present themselves, and others will become self-evident.
"""

(Note: because of the mcp client's behaviour, the server must announce only the tool capability, but provide a list_prompts handler and a list_resources handler which return an empty list, to avoid method not found errors)
